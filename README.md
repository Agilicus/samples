## Agilicus Samples

These are various samples of integrations to the Agilicus Platform.
Each uses the [Agilicus API](http://www.agilicus.com/api).

The original location of this code is at [Agilicus Gitlab](https://git.agilicus.com/pub/),
and a read-only mirror is present on Github.

For questions, comments, feedback on the samples, please either email dev@agilicus.com,
or use the Chat Icon on [https://www.agilicus.com/](https://www.agilicus.com).

Some use the API directly, others use the [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/agilicus/)
or the [Angular SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agilicus/angular).
